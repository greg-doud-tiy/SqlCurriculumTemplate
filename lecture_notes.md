## Lecture Notes

[comment]: # (Bulleted list of each item to cover during the lecture. Very high level. Details about the lecture are found in the lesson plan. Think of this as a bullet list an instructor can print out to make sure they hit all the details they need to during their lecture. Its a cheat sheet outline for the lecture.)
