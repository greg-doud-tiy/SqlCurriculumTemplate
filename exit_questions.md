## Exit Questions

[comment]: # (Exit questions should be answerable by students by the end of the day - after the lecture and lab. They shouldn't be that hard, and should center around new concepts and terms. We want to ensure that students are grasping the most basic ideas before moving on to other subjects. Between 1 or 2 questions.)
