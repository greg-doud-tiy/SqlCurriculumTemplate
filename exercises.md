## Exercises

[comment]: # (Practice problems, Newline exercises, word problems, research questions, scenerios, critical analysis, micro projects, etc. Anything that tests the students skills and competencies in a short and focused manner. Each exercies should be focused on one competency only, no large summative projects.)
