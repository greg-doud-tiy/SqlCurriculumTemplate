## Study Notes

[comment]: # (Student-facing materials. Should be short and sweet. No long-form exposition. Instead, list and define new terms associated delivered during the lecture. Give short, concise explanations of new concepts, provide useful code samples and examples. This is not a text book. Instead, it is supplimentary to the lecture.)
